// Okay, so, you need to create your webdriver interface page
// Once you've got a basic one, get it to take a screenshot
// Save this screenshot, then upon rerunning, take a new screenshot save as thing.new?
// NO
// Open page with resemble and load your images - done
//
//
//
// screenshot testing is very messy and I don't want to rewrite it all. though to be fair I'm just waiting on a click now...
